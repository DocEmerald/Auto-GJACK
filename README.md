# Auto-GJACK
This is a script that automatically does grammar jacks in ROBLOX, I made this a while ago but it's public now. Made primarily for Ro-Nation's and military groups, can do infinite jacks.





# Installation

Pretty straightforward, you can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/DocEmerald/Auto-GJACK/releases). The .exe may say its not trusted/not commonly downloaded, you can still download it by clicking the up arrow then "keep". If you don't trust it, you can open the .py file in Python's IDLE and take a look at the code, like I said it's really short and straightforward.

Downloading the all caps version is similar, and you should find it at the aforementioned releases page.

# Usage

Usage is also quite simple, if you're working with the .exe,  just answer how many grammar jacks you want to do, and give it the 5 seconds needed until it starts.

If you're using the .py, it should be the same, relatively simple and answer the quesitons you need to, then let it do its work.
